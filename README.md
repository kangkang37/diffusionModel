# diffusion model project

Building a diffusion model based on the U-Net network from scratch, and using the Fashion-MNIST dataset for model training and sampling.

## run
open jupyter notebook or colab, run the file 'SD_DDPM.ipynb'

The diffusion.git demonstrates the process of taking a pure noise image and progressively denoising it layer by layer with a trained diffusion model, eventually obtaining a clean image.

The weights folder contains the trained models, which can be used for sampling.
